				<h2 class="sub-header subone"> About Me </h2>
				<p> My name is Thomas and i am a entry level Java/ Css/ Html/ PHP/ Pascal delveloper <br><br>
					The thing I love most about programming and testing is that it requires me to use my problem solving skills extensively. 
					I also love the challenge of always needing to solve new problems. When a difficult problem comes along, 
					I will do whatever is needed to find a solution. This includes working with my team, 
					and using their knowledge in order to find the best possible solution.  
                                        
                                        If you would like to see some of the projects i have done there is a link to my github at the bottom

				<img class="img-responsive thumbnail" src="img/Merge.png">			
				<p>	At Planswift I created a pascal plugin for our primary software that would merge multiple construction estimates together. 
					There had been a lot of customers asking for that plug in for a long time, yet no one had created it. I took it upon my self to create that plugin, as I new it would 
					provide a great value to our customers and business. This project was a great learning experience, as I had to learn pascal and I had to learn about the plugin api for 
					Planswift's program.
